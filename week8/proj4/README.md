# Project 4: Brevet time calculator with Ajax

Reimplement the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with Flask and Ajax.

Author: Boyana Norris

## ACP controle times

That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control" is also accepted. Controls are points where a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the minimum and maximum times by which the rider must arrive at the location.

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described here (https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator). Additional background information is given here (https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders). The description is ambiguous, but the examples help. Part of finishing this project is clarifying anything that is not clear about the requirements, and documenting it clearly.

We are essentially replacing the calculator here (https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html). We can also use that calculator to clarify requirements and develop test data.
